  <pre class=abouttxt>Starting on roughly the 20th of September 2017â€“ 
the Galashiels Academy Space Club was founded by <a href=https://www.instagram.com/beyond.the.terra/>Phillip Tovell.</a>  
The club aims to educate its members on the recent space news, and space related knowledge in general.
After leaving leaving school to pursue his interest in astronomy, Phillip left the club to some of the younger members. 
From 2018 to the present, the club has been run by Max Wilson, and Lewis Edmunds. 
Welcoming any student or staff member that wants to learn more about space and take part in fun group activities, such as model rocket building.</pre>
